# Simple React UI Kit - Playground

This playground provides an interactive way to explore and customize the Simple React UI Kit components with real-time theme controls.

## Features

### Theme Controls

- **Border Radius**: Choose from 6 different radius options (None, Small, Medium, Large, Extra Large, Full)
- **Color Palette**: Switch between 6 color schemes (Blue, Green, Purple, Red, Orange, Gray)
- **Size**: Adjust component sizes (Small, Medium, Large)

### Interactive Components

- **Buttons**: All variants (Primary, Secondary, Outline, Ghost, Danger) with loading and disabled states
- **Inputs**: Different states including default, helper text, error, and disabled
- **Cards**: Sample cards with headers, bodies, and footers
- **Badges**: All badge variants with different colors

## How to Use

1. **Start the development server**:

   ```bash
   npm run preview
   ```

2. **Open your browser** and navigate to `http://localhost:3000`

3. **Experiment with theme controls**:

   - Use the "Border Radius" controls to change the corner radius of all components
   - Switch between different "Color Palette" options to see how colors change
   - Adjust the "Size" controls to see components in different sizes

4. **Real-time updates**: All changes are applied immediately to see how your design system looks with different configurations

## Component Showcase

The playground demonstrates:

- **Responsive design** with proper spacing and layout
- **Accessibility features** with proper focus states and ARIA attributes
- **Consistent theming** across all components
- **Interactive states** like hover, focus, and disabled

## Customization

You can extend the playground by:

- Adding more color palettes
- Including additional component variants
- Adding more size options
- Creating custom theme presets

The playground uses React Context to manage theme state and provides a clean, professional interface similar to popular design system playgrounds like Radix UI.
